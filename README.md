# e-commerce-api

## Description
This is a simple ecommerce database api. It includes category, product, and tag data. This is woven into express server capabilities, allowing routes to each table. Each table includes routes for getting all data, getting data by id, posting data, updating data of a certain id, and deleting data of a certain id. 

## Usage
This application could be used for storing the aforementioned category, product, and tag data of your ecommerce site.

## Installation
To get this running on your device, you first have to install the code from the repository here. Once you do that, you have to install all of the npm packages. Make sure you have mysql, and use it to source the database by using the schema in the db folder. Then use node to run the index.js file in the seeds folder, to seed the database with some example data. Once all of this is done, you can run the server.js with node and the server will start up on your device.

## My contributions
This was an assignment for school and I was given premade code to work with and make additions to. My additions are the column code for the models, the relationial code for the models, the route capabilities for the database, and other small things.
